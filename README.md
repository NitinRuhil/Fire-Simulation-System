# Fire Simulation System

This project is a 3D fire simulation built using **Unity** and **C#**.
It models how fire spreads in an environment and visualizes the behavior of flames, heat, and burning objects in real time.

The goal of this project is to simulate fire dynamics for learning, safety analysis, and visualization purposes.

## How to Run the Project

### Option 1: Using Unity Package

1. Install **Unity Hub**
2. Open Unity Hub and create a new 3D project
3. Import the file:
   `FireSimulationSystem.unitypackage`
4. Open the main scene
5. Click the **Play** button to start the simulation

### Option 2: Using Source Folder

1. Open Unity Hub
2. Click **Open Project**
3. Select the folder: `FireSimulationSystem`
4. Let Unity load all assets
5. Press **Play** to run the simulation
